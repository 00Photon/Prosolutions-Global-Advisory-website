Grenada, often overlooked, remains one of the most strategic citizenship-by-investment programs in the world. The
reason is simple: it offers something no other Caribbean citizenship does.

Alongside visa-free access to over 140 destinations, Grenada is the only Caribbean country with an active E-2 treaty
with the United States. That single advantage allows citizens to apply for US residency through business investment -
legally, cleanly, and efficiently.

Investors choose Grenada because it provides options, not obligations. There is no residency requirement, no wealth tax,
no global income tax, and a fast processing timeline.

**Why Grenada will remain top-tier in 2026**

- Strong, diversified economy with tourism and real estate growth
- Low entry cost compared to global CBI programs
- Dependents, including parents and siblings, are eligible
- Attractive property-linked developments with steady rental demand
- Strategic passport for mobility, investment flexibility, and risk management

Grenada's value is not in the passport itself, but in the doors that passport quietly opens. If you want to secure your
family's future, preserve wealth, and unlock new commercial opportunities, speak with our Citizenship advisors.
