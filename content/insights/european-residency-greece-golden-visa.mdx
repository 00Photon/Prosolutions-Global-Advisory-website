The Greece Golden Visa continues to dominate Europe's residency market, and 2026 may be its strongest year yet. While
other European programs have tightened or closed, Greece has managed to strike the perfect equilibrium: a stable EU
jurisdiction, an affordable real estate threshold, a fast and predictable residency process, no physical presence
requirement, and a clear pathway to permanent residency and citizenship.

For families, investors, retirees, and global professionals, Greece offers something rare: European access without
European complexity. The program remains the region's best value play because a minimum EUR 250,000 property investment
(in select zones) can secure:

- Five-year renewable residency
- Schengen mobility for the full family
- Inclusion of spouse, children, and parents
- Full property ownership rights
- Long-term appreciation and rental income potential

Greece is not just a residency program. It is a lifestyle upgrade, an investment opportunity, and a geopolitical
insurance policy wrapped into one. If you are planning your 2026 relocation blueprint, this is the benchmark to measure
against.
