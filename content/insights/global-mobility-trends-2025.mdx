The next two years will be defined by mobility optionality. Digital nomad visas are now a permanent feature of most G20
economies, and the fastest growing applicants are senior executives seeking dual work locations rather than lifestyle
influencers. African UHNW families, in particular, are pairing Caribbean citizenship with Gulf or EU residency permits
to diversify access.

We also expect deeper background checks as regulators harmonise AML standards. Families that prepare compliance files,
source-of-wealth documentation, and succession plans before starting an application will continue to enjoy the fastest
approval times. Our guidance is simple: treat mobility as a board-level agenda item, not an afterthought.
