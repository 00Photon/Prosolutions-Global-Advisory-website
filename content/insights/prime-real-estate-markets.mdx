This quarter, luxury real estate has proven once again that it is less an asset class and more a resilience strategy.
From Dubai to Lisbon to Singapore, prime property markets continue to outperform expectations as global investors
reposition capital amid geopolitical uncertainty and inflation. The wealthy are not chasing returns; they are chasing
geographical security and asset protection.

> "The world's wealthy aren't looking for homes - they're looking for safe havens."

**Top-performing prime markets this quarter**

- **Dubai:** A magnet for global wealth with record-breaking off-plan launches and rental yields rivaling major
  financial hubs.
- **Lisbon and Cascais:** Lifestyle appeal, stability, and steady long-term appreciation.
- **Cyprus:** Strong demand from expats, investors, and European families seeking relocation-friendly luxury.
- **Singapore:** Ultra-stable, low-risk, and resilient against global volatility.

The luxury property narrative is shifting. Investors are not asking, "Where is the highest yield?" but "Where is my
capital safest?" Prime real estate in 2025 is less about square meters and more about strategic sovereignty. Speak with
