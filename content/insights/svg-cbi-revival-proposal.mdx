> "What if one small island's change of heart could reshape the future of Caribbean citizenship forever?"

That is the question stirring across Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG), a country long known for its resistance to
passport-for-sale programs. In December 2025, Major St. Clair Leacock, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
National Security and Immigration, signaled a dramatic pivot: he described a carefully managed CBI scheme as a cornerstone
of national economic renewal, emphasising transparency, accountability, and job creation for Vincentians.

## From opposition to opportunity

For decades, SVG stood apart from its Caribbean peers such as Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Dominica. Efforts to reintroduce
CBI were repeatedly blocked by leadership that rejected the notion of selling passports. Now, with a new political
climate and the NDP (opposition party) promising implementation, Deputy PM Leacock's public endorsement suggests SVG may
soon join the region's CBI fraternity.

## What the Deputy PM is proposing

Leacock's remarks reveal a vision beyond quick revenue:

- Robust governance and transparency with oversight by the Ministry of Security, the Attorney General's office, and
  allied institutions
- Economic renewal through jobs and infrastructure investments funded by CBI receipts
- Learning from peers to ensure invested funds are managed responsibly and visibly

## What public opinion says

A May 2025 Sentinel Research Group poll found that 62 percent of Vincentians support introducing a CBI program even
though the current government has opposed it. Key findings included:

- 76 percent believe a CBI program could inject revenue, create jobs, and improve public services
- 68 percent do not believe selling citizenship would diminish national identity

In short, there is strong appetite for economic opportunity if it is delivered transparently.

## What this could mean for the region

If SVG launches a well-regulated program, the impact could be significant:

- A new entrant in the CBI market, giving investors another option for mobility and diversification
- Catalyst funding for public works, healthcare, education, and climate resilience
- A chance to reset the narrative around CBI programs by proving that rigorous governance can coexist with foreign
  capital inflows

## Challenges not yet solved

The path ahead remains demanding:

- Building robust, transparent institutions to administer the program fairly and safely
- Avoiding pitfalls seen elsewhere, such as over-reliance on real estate or weak links between investments and long-term
  economic benefits
- Ensuring benefits are shared broadly among Vincentians instead of being captured by elites

## Final thought

SVG's potential pivot could mark a turning point not just for the island, but for the broader Caribbean. If handled with
integrity and vision, the country could transform foreign investment into sustainable growth and new opportunities for
its people. For investors watching regional mobility trends, SVG may become one of the must-watch jurisdictions in 2026.
