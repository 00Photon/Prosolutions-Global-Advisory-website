The UAE corporate tax regime has moved from concept to enforcement. Inspectors now expect to see economic substance
reports, inter-company agreements, and transfer-pricing files that align with the OECD rulebook. Multinationals must
prove genuine decision-making in the Emirates—not just leased desks and nominee directors.

Private capital vehicles are also under scrutiny. Family offices using holding companies for regional investments
should reassess their structures and ensure governance minutes, cash-flow trails, and banking arrangements match the
declared activities. Our compliance pod now runs quarterly readiness reviews that bring finance, legal, and board
reporting into one secure workflow.
